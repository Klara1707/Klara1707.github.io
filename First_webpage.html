    <h2>She Codes: My Journey in to Coding</h2>
    <p>She Code has been an incredible opportunity for me to dive into the world of coding. It’s a program designed to
      empower women by providing them with the tools and confidence to explore new possibilities, and it has been a
      transformative experience for me.
    </p>
    <h3>My First Project: Building a Website with HTML and CSS</h3>
    <p>The very first step in my coding journey was creating a website using HTML and CSS. This foundational project
      taught me so much:
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>I learned the basics of web development, which felt like uncovering the building blocks of the internet.
      </li>
      <li>I stepped into a new and exciting field that challenged me in the best possible way.</li>
      <li>I experienced the joy and satisfaction of bringing an idea to life through code.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>An Eye-Opening Experience</h3>
    <p>For me, She Code wasn’t just about acquiring technical skills—it was about discovering a whole new world. Each
      challenge I faced became an opportunity to grow, and the process was both fun and deeply rewarding. From writing
      my first line of code to watching my website come to life, I found myself falling in love with the creativity
      and logic behind coding.
    </p>
    <h3>A Moment of Pride</h3>
    <p>Completing my first website was a proud and unforgettable milestone. It wasn’t just a project; it was a
      testament to my perseverance and the skills I had gained. That moment solidified my passion for coding and
      marked the beginning of what I hope will be a long and exciting journey in the tech world.
      She Code has opened doors I never thought possible, and I’m so excited to keep learning and building. This is
      just the start, and I can’t wait to see where it leads.
